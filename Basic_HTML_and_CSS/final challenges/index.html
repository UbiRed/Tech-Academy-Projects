            <div class="column">The first iteration of the Acura NSX was introduced for model year 1991, although it was available in non-US markets as the Honda NSX in 1990. These initial cars was powered by an all-aluminium 3.0 L V6 engine, cars that are known as NA1 models. Initially launched as a Coupe, the NSX received its first major evolution for model year 1995 in the form of a Targa removable roof top, cars that have become known as the NA1 NSX-T. Sold until 1998, the NA1's were phased out by the more powerful NA2 Models starting in 1997.</div>
            <div class="column">The Acura NSX saw the arrival of a larger 3.2 L V6 engine for model year 1998, cars that are known as the NA2 models (note that some NA1 Models would continue to be sold into 1998). NA2 models are equipped with an automatic or 6-speed manual transmission (as opposed to the 5-speed of the NA1's). In North America, the body style from this range would continue with a targa roof top, except for the coupe limited production NSX Zanardi Edition, as well as a handful of special order NA2 Coupes. Apart from the Zanardi Edition, other NA2 variants are all NSX-T targa topped cars: The 'Pre-Facelift' Cars (1998 To 2001), and the later 'Facelift' Cars (2002 To 2005) which gained fixed headlights instead of pop-up headlights.  The NSX was discontinued with the last of the NA2's after model year 2005 and revived for the 2nd Generation Acura NSX for model year 2017. </div>
